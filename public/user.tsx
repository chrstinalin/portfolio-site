			subtitle: "May 2023 - Present",
			description:
				`Developed & deployed a Node.js CRUD web application under a Canadian pallet manufacturing conglomerate. Redesigned, migrated, and extended both the SQL Server database and the original ColdFusion enterprise resource planning (ERP) software to a modern tech stack. 
				
				The system manages various key business processes of four subsidiary companies, including scheduling and dispatching contracts valued in the hundreds of thousands with retail & warehouse companies such as Amazon, Walmart and Home Depot. 
				
				This opportunity gave me a strong understanding of the fullstack development process. 
				
				On the backend, I developed the software's API & algorithms, its communication with the SQL Server, and its access control & policy management. In the frontend, I designed & developed a web-based React application to facilitate communication with the API. I also deployed these services on traditional CentOS servers.

				Currently, I'm retained as a part-time employee to maintain & continue to develop the software.`,
